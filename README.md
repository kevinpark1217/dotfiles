# dotfiles
> My personal `.dotfiles`

## Setup
It's easy as 1-2-3!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinpark1217/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```

## Troubleshooting
**Terminal**
- Run `chsh -s $(which zsh)` to change the default shell to `zsh`
- Change the font to `Fira Mono` to fix broken characters.
